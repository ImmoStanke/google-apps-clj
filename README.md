# google-apps-clj

A Clojure library that wraps the Google Java API for different Google Applications. This library is fully supported by [core.typed](https://github.com/clojure/core.typed)

## Obtaining
If you are using Leiningen, you can add
```
[google-apps-clj "0.1.1"]
```
to your project.clj file and then run
```
lein deps
```
to download it from Clojars.

If you are using Maven:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>google-apps-clj</groupId>
  <artifactId>google-apps-clj</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Currently supported APIs

* Google OAuth 2.0
* Google Drive
* Google Spreadsheets.

## Usage
In order to use any of these APIs, you must first use the Google OAuth 2.0 library to set up your credentials. All the APIs rely on the credentials received from setting up OAuth 2.0.

### Obtaining OAuth 2 Credentials

1. Log in to Google using the account you wish the credentials to be under
2. Navigate to the [Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
3. Create a project and name it appropriately
4. Navigate to Credentials and click *Create new Client ID* under OAuth
5. Create a [google-creds.edn file](https://github.com/dunn-mat/google-apps-clj/blob/master/config/google-creds.edn.template)
6. Copy the Client ID, Client Secret, and Redirect URIs into your google-creds.edn. You will use the data in this file for getting the rest of your credententials and for the other APIs.
7. Read in your google-creds.edn file like so:

     `(edn/read-string (slurp "config/matt-google-creds.edn"))`

8. Call get-auth-map on this read in data and follow its instructions
9. Copy the returned data into your google-creds.edn file under the `:auth-map` key. Reload it into your REPL.
10. You are now ready to use the other APIs with your credential file

### Drive API

##### Supported Functionality

* Uploading a file to drive
* Downloading a file to drive

### Spreadsheet API

##### Supported Functionality

* Creating a Worksheet inside of an existing Spreadsheet
* Finding Spreadsheets by title and id, Worksheets by title and id, Cells by row column notation
* Editing a Worksheet's rows, columns, and title
* Editing individual cells in a Worksheet
* Editing rows in a worksheet
* Batch-updating large quantity of cells (improves performance)
* Reading an entire Worksheet's values or headers, or both
* Overwriting an entire Worksheet with a new set of data (destroys old data)

## What's Next?

#### Drive API

* Create a new blank file
* Updating an existing file's title and description
* Updating an existing file's associated properties
